[Hello, World!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MrEkwt-wZ5w) I am the DataByte. This repo hosts my Excel files that I walk through in my linear regression series on YouTube. 

Check out my video [Linear Regression with Excel, Python & R](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWoRWu5FUZQ) to hear more about these topics:

# Mathematics

In my YouTube video, I give a short mathematical explanation of how linear regression trendlines are calculated with the least squares method. 

## R<sup>2</sup> value 

The r<sup>2</sup> value (the coefficient of determination) helps you determine if your data is exhibiting linear behavior or not. R<sup>2</sup> values range between 0 and 1, with 1 indicating a perfect linear trend. Values beteween 0.7 and 1 indicate that your data has a linear trend, the closer to 1, the better. You probably don't want to be using any linear trendlines with r<sup>2</sup> values less than 0.7 to make predictions. 

# Code

There are ways to code in Excel with VBA but it's not needed here. Simply the `TREND()` or `LINEST()` functions are needed in Excel to fit a linear trendline.

It is easy to find sources online to learn more about linear regression, here are some great references to what I used.
